## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks (Day 3 Afternoon)

1. **Booking Workflow Implementation**
   - Create Booking model and schema
   - Implement booking service for CRUD operations
   - Develop booking approval workflow
   - Create payment schedule generation system
   - Build booking-related API endpoints

2. **Lead-to-Booking Conversion Flow**
   - Create conversion process from lead to booking
   - Implement discount approval workflow
   - Develop cost sheet generation system
   - Build APIs for conversion operations

### Day 4 Planned Tasks

1. **Payment Schedule Management**
   - Create payment schedule model
   - Implement milestone-based payment tracking
   - Build payment notification system
   - Develop payment reconciliation process

2. **Document Management**
   - Set up secure document storage
   - Create document versioning system
   - Implement role-based document access
   - Build document API endpoints

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design

- **Multi-tenant Data Model**: Each entity includes a `tenantId` field for strict data isolation
- **Compound Indexes**: Will be used for efficient querying across tenant boundaries
- **Embedded vs Referenced Documents**: We'll use a mix based on entity relationships and query patterns

### API Structure

- **RESTful Design**: Following REST principles for resource management
- **Versioned APIs**: `/api/v1/...` pattern to allow for future versioning
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens

### LLM Integration

- **Abstraction Layer**: LLM interactions will be isolated in dedicated services
- **Intent-Based Architecture**: User inputs will be classified into intents with extracted entities
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured system prompts with dynamic content insertion

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. System generates JWT access token (short-lived) and refresh token (longer-lived)
3. Client includes access token in each request
4. When access token expires, client uses refresh token to obtain a new pair

### Multi-tenant Architecture

- Every API endpoint will include tenant isolation middleware
- Database queries will automatically filter by tenant ID
- Role permissions will be tenant-specific
- Shared resources will use tenant-based isolation

### LLM Integration Strategy

- OpenAI GPT-4o will be used as the primary model
- Context management will maintain conversation history
- Function calling will be used for structured outputs
- Tenant-specific rules will be injected into system prompts

### Lead Management

- Lead status workflow enforces proper sales process
- Comprehensive interaction tracking captures all communications
- Unit interest tracking links leads to specific inventory
- RBAC ensures proper access control for sensitive lead data
- Statistics provide insights into sales pipeline performance

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes

### Git Workflow

- Currently using a single `main` branch for rapid development
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commits format
- Regular commits should be made to track progress

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mocking for external dependencies
- Test database for MongoDB operations

## Open Challenges & Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Need to implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider database query optimization for larger datasets
- Implement pagination for list endpoints

### Security Considerations

- Need to enhance input validation
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### LLM Cost Management

- Need to implement token optimization
- Consider caching common LLM responses
- Implement usage tracking and quotas
