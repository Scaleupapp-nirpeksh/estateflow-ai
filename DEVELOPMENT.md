## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Tasks (Day 4 Afternoon)

1. **Document Management Implementation**
   - Create document storage system with AWS S3 integration
   - Implement document metadata tracking
   - Build document versioning and history
   - Develop document access control based on roles
   - Create document templates for agreements and receipts

2. **Dashboard and Reporting**
   - Build business intelligence dashboard framework
   - Implement sales performance reports
   - Create payment collection and forecasting reports
   - Develop executive summary dashboards
   - Build export functionality for reports

### Day 5 Planned Tasks

1. **Conversational AI Integration**
   - Set up OpenAI integration
   - Create intent classification for natural language commands
   - Implement entity extraction for identifying objects in commands
   - Build prompt templates for different operations
   - Create response formatters for consistent AI outputs

2. **System Testing and Optimization**
   - Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows
   - Optimize database queries for performance
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Set up monitoring and logging for production
   - Create documentation for API endpoints

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design

- **Multi-tenant Data Model**: Each entity includes a `tenantId` field for strict data isolation
- **Compound Indexes**: Used for efficient querying across tenant boundaries
- **Embedded vs Referenced Documents**: Mix based on entity relationships and query patterns
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive change tracking with user information and timestamps

### API Structure

- **RESTful Design**: Following REST principles for resource management
- **Versioned APIs**: `/api/v1/...` pattern to allow for future versioning
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens
- **Role-based Authorization**: Different endpoints have different role requirements

### Booking Workflow Architecture

- **Status-based Workflow**: Bookings follow a clear progression of statuses
- **Approval System**: Flexible approval chains based on discount amounts and user roles
- **Payment Schedule Management**: Customizable payment plans with installment tracking
- **Document Generation**: Dynamic document creation with tenant branding

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. System generates JWT access token (short-lived) and refresh token (longer-lived)
3. Client includes access token in each request
4. When access token expires, client uses refresh token to obtain a new pair

### Multi-tenant Architecture

- Every API endpoint includes tenant isolation middleware
- Database queries automatically filter by tenant ID
- Role permissions are tenant-specific
- Shared resources use tenant-based isolation

### Lead Management

- Lead status workflow enforces proper sales process
- Comprehensive interaction tracking captures all communications
- Unit interest tracking links leads to specific inventory
- RBAC ensures proper access control for sensitive lead data
- Statistics provide insights into sales pipeline performance

### Booking and Payment System

- Booking creation automatically updates unit status
- Discount approval workflow ensures proper authorization
- Payment schedules support both percentage and fixed amount installments
- Dynamic recalculation adjusts remaining payments when changes are made
- Audit trails track all changes with user information and timestamps

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes

### Git Workflow

- Currently using a single `main` branch for rapid development
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commits format
- Regular commits should be made to track progress

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mocking for external dependencies
- Test database for MongoDB operations

## Open Challenges & Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Need to implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider database query optimization for larger datasets
- Implement pagination for list endpoints

### Security Considerations

- Need to enhance input validation
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Document Storage

- Need to implement secure document storage
- Consider versioning strategy for documents
- Implement access controls for documents
