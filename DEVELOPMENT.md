   - Define data structure for UI components
   - Create API integration examples
   - Document authentication flow for frontend
   - Build example dashboard visualizations

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design

- **Multi-tenant Data Model**: Each entity includes a `tenantId` field for strict data isolation
- **Compound Indexes**: Used for efficient querying across tenant boundaries
- **Embedded vs Referenced Documents**: Mix based on entity relationships and query patterns
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive change tracking with user information and timestamps

### API Structure

- **RESTful Design**: Following REST principles for resource management
- **Versioned APIs**: `/api/v1/...` pattern to allow for future versioning
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens
- **Role-based Authorization**: Different endpoints have different role requirements

### Booking Workflow Architecture

- **Status-based Workflow**: Bookings follow a clear progression of statuses
- **Approval System**: Flexible approval chains based on discount amounts and user roles
- **Payment Schedule Management**: Customizable payment plans with installment tracking
- **Document Generation**: Dynamic document creation with tenant branding

### Dashboard and Reporting Architecture

- **Analytics Service**: MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient data analysis
- **Report Generation**: CSV export with AWS S3 integration for storage
- **API-First Design**: Backend-only implementation ready for any frontend
- **Tenant Isolation**: All analytics and reports are scoped to tenant data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Analytics Implementation

- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Complex MongoDB aggregations for efficient data analysis
- **Metrics Calculation**: Runtime calculation of KPIs like conversion rates and collection efficiency
- **Flexible Filtering**: Support for date ranges, projects, towers, and other dimensions
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexes on common aggregation fields for better performance

### Report Generation System

- **CSV Export**: Formatted data export with column mappings
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Secure storage with signed URLs for time-limited access
- **Background Processing**: Asynchronous report generation for better user experience
- **Filtering Capabilities**: Granular control over report content through filters

### Dashboard Metrics Structure

- **Executive Summary**: High-level KPIs for management overview
- **Sales Performance**: Detailed metrics on bookings, revenue, and agents
- **Financial Analysis**: Collection efficiency, aging analysis, and projections
- **Inventory Status**: Availability, absorption rates, and value metrics

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions and classes

### Git Workflow

- Currently using a single `main` branch for rapid development
- Commit messages should be descriptive and follow conventional commits format
- Regular commits should be made to track progress

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mocking for external dependencies
- Test database for MongoDB operations

## Open Challenges & Considerations

### Performance Optimization

- Need to implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider database query optimization for larger datasets
- Implement pagination for list endpoints

### Security Considerations

- Need to enhance input validation
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Document Storage

- Need to implement secure document storage
- Consider versioning strategy for documents
- Implement access controls for documents
